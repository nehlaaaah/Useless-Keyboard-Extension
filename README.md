### Project Description
[A website that displays an on-screen keyboard, which can only be operated by typing on an external keyboard. It completely ignores mouse clicks, making it a totally impractical tool for on-screen typing.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Have you ever thought typing into a website with your keyboard was too simple? Or that it was too easy to click on an on-screen keyboard? By enabling users to type using an on-screen keyboard without mouse functionality, this extension addresses the "problem" of efficiency.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Presenting the website "Useless Keyboard"! It only displays what you type on an on-screen keyboard, but it allows you to type by... typing on your real keyboard. Additionally, using a mouse to click the on-screen keys does nothing!]
